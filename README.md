# Voice-Controlled-Home-Automation-System
The proposed system is a distributed home automation system, consists of server, sensors. Server controls and monitors the various sensors, and can be easily configured to handle more hardware interface module (sensors). This project is based on the construction of a model simulating a home automation with different operation modes which can be controlled also by a mobile application. To achieve this objective, a scale house that captures different signals, both digital and analog, has been developed. To approach the house to a real home automation application the variables under study and control are lighting home appliances and other electrical objects.
